# Defender
A simplified version of the classic Atari 2600 game: Defender

Get ready to defend the earth from hordes and more hordes of terrible aliens! This game was inspired by the Atari 2600 classic game released in 1980: Defender; the player controls a spaceship equipped with laser beams and its main mission is to protect the earth from an alien attack; the player begins with three lives, these being lost when the player is hit by an enemy shot, reaches the boundaries of the scenery or clashes with an enemy ship; when the player is hit by an enemy the ship's energy is redirected to the deflector shields, ensuring the same a brief immunity to enemy damage; Enemies are destroyed when hit by player shots, causing the player to accumulate ten points for each enemy.
Be careful! Not all technology in the world can circumvent the laws of physics; Because of the high amounts of energy required to trigger your laser beam weapon can only make five shots, use them wisely can be the difference between an enemy horde and the safety of humanity.
NOTE: This game has been developed and designed for Windows, its execution on other operating systems may result in malfunction or, even, not running key features of the game.
